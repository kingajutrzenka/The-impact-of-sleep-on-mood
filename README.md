**The Impact of Sleep on Mood**

This project is about how sleep affects people‚Äôs mood.

Research question: Does the amount of sleep affect people‚Äôs mood the next day?

I analyzed:
- age
- total sleep hours
- sleep quality
- productivity score
- mood score
- stress level
  
This project reflects my interest in Data Science, especially in the context of Psychology. I want to learn more in this field and share my findings with you üòâ.

I used data from Kaggle: ‚ÄúSleep Cycle & Productivity‚Äù.
My perspective is based on an article from the American Psychology Association: ‚ÄúSleep deprivation makes us less happy and more anxious.‚Äù

These statistics show no correlation between sleep and productivity, mood, or stress. I was shocked when I saw this result, because in article: "Sleep deprivation makres us less happy and more anxious" is a big correlation between these things.
In my point of view, 5,000 people is too small a group for this experiment, so I don‚Äôt see the correlation.

In the future, I want to try another dataset and compare these analyses.
