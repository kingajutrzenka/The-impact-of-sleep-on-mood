**The Impact of Sleep on Mood**

This project is about how sleep affects people’s mood.

Research question: Does the amount of sleep affect people’s mood the next day?

I analyzed:
	•	sleep_hours
	•	mood_score

This project reflects my interest in Data Science, especially in the context of Psychology. I want to learn more in this field and share my findings with you 😉.

I used data from Kaggle: “Sleep Cycle & Productivity”.
My perspective is based on an article from the American Psychology Association: “Sleep deprivation makes us less happy and more anxious.”
